### Transition to Deeper Network Basic Mining 2.0: A New Chapter for Genesis Mining Users

#### **Introduction: A Journey Towards a Trusted Internet**

Deeper Network's journey began with the vision of creating a secure network resource-sharing platform, a truly decentralized consensus network, and a trusted internet development platform. The release of Deeper Connect in early 2019 marked a significant milestone, combining cybersecurity technology, network sharing economy, and blockchain technology in an innovative blend.

Designed with plug-and-play and zero configuration, Deeper Connect provides an all-in-one network security solution. Its core, AtomOS, is the world's first lock-free network operating system, ensuring high reliability, performance, and scalability. From network security to blockchain technology, Deeper Network has been at the forefront of creating a trusted Internet where personal data sovereignty is guaranteed.

#### **Genesis Plan Termination: A Strategic Transition**

As Deeper Chain celebrates its second anniversary online, we announce the termination of the Genesis plan on the 28th of this month. All Genesis users will be automatically switched to Basic Mining 2.0, a scheme that offers an APY 10% higher than that of ordinary users.

**Key Details of the Transition**:

1. **Pledged DPR Remains Unchanged**: The pledged DPR remains unchanged and will not be released.
2. **Voluntary Withdrawal Option**: Genesis users may voluntarily withdraw from the pledge, thereby releasing DPR, and still maintain the 90-day linear release rule.
3. **Automatic Transition**: Genesis users will switch automatically without any action required.
4. **Income APY for Basic Mining 2.0**: Basic Mining 2.0 income for Genesis users is higher by 10%.
5. **Reduction of Extra Income**: The additional income of Genesis users will be reduced by 1% every six months, until it is reduced to 5% of the additional income, and will not be reduced, maintaining an additional APY of 5%.

#### **Impact on Genesis Users and the DPR Price**

The transition to Basic Mining 2.0 is more than a mere change in the mining scheme. It represents a strategic move that can reduce the daily DPR release, contributing positively to the DPR price in the long run. Genesis users will continue to enjoy benefits while supporting the overall stability and growth of the Deeper Network ecosystem.
